My website for a ibm tes.
Task:
The service is supposed to provide the name of the film and the location of all films that have been shot in San Francisco.
Data is available here: https://data.sfgov.org/Culture-and-Recreation/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am
The created service should only contain the location and the name of the film (not all data)
